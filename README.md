# Budgeting script for automation of personal finance
- Built a google spreadsheet and accompanying python script to automate finance portfolio and budgeting statistics, saving 2 hours/month
  - Script takes user input purchase or income and category and computes relevant informations before outputting into the google sheet on the cloud
- Used python and google sheets API

### Future Plans
- My next step: Utilize Selenium to scrape my bank's website, log in as the user, and pull in expenses and income without user intervention.
